# Linked List

This project implements a simple linked list data structure in JavaScript. A linked list is a linear collection of data elements, called nodes, each pointing to the next node by means of a pointer. It is a sequence of nodes where each node stores its own data and a link to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion and removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration.
